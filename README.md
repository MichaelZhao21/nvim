# My Neovim config

I'm trying out Neovim as a replacement to VSCode (because it's slow and kinda glitchy). I like the Vim keybinds, so I want to see if I can use it as a full-blown IDE with some plugins. Keep in mind this is a WIP, so it will constantly change

## Installation

To install, clone this repo and the [packer plugin](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim). Then, simply run `:PackerSync` from a nvim buffer to install the remaining plugins.
